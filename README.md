# Neotropic: Creation of a Modular Environment

Neotropic is an asset pack created for my Bachelor's Degree Final Thesis. We can use it to create stylized cyberpunk environments faster with modular meshes and unique materials. Optimized and game ready only for [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/).

As time goes by, things evolve, usually for the better, and video games are no different.
If we take a look at the history of video games, we can see that environments are
becoming more detailed, more innovative and better in terms of visual quality and
optimisation than before. That is why environment artists must understand how to
best combine visual fidelity with performance and high-volume productivity.

Modularity or modular architecture is a very useful technique in environment art,
giving the artist the solution to avoid art fatigue and production delays during the
development of a video game. In addition, teams benefit from the flexibility and
effectiveness of working with modular assets.

Working on an environment with modular techniques proved beneficial in terms of
speed and flexibility when creating the design of the level. Otherwise, when poorly
designed, it fails to achieve the intended level of optimisation.
